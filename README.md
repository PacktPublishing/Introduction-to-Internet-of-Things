## About the Video Course
IoT is a hot area and it has the potential to impact a variety of industries. This course is designed to initiate the widest possible group of people to the field of IoT and will be comprehensive in its scope. This course supplies in-depth content that put the theory into practice. 
The course will start with a basic introduction to IoT and take the student through an IoT solution case study. You will then be given with another case study to understand the building blocks of a typical IoT solution which will introduce the Sparkfun ESP8266 “Thing”, which is a customized ESP8266 development board which we will use to rapidly prototype IoT solutions. The course will then introduce you to Cayenne - a drag and drop IoT platform which helps you to build IoT solutions fast without any programming needed, it also assists you in building interesting IoT solutions that cover all the basic building blocks of IoT.
Finally, you will be able to build IoT solutions on your own to solve your business needs.
